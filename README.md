## 🎯 Placement Strategy

- Solve problems topic-wise and **master patterns**.  
- Revise notes and **cheat sheets regularly**.  
- Solve **medium → hard problems** across all DSA topics.  
- Target **200–300 quality problems** before placements.

## ⚡ How to Use

- Navigate by topic folders for practice and reference.  
- Use notes to understand approaches & patterns.  
- All code is in **Java** (primary language for placements).  
- Problems are categorized by **difficulty** where applicable.
