# 📘 DSA Preparation Repository

This repository contains my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** practice, organized topic-wise.  
I use it to practice for placements (6–10 LPA target) and to keep **notes + code** in one place.

## 📝 Notes
- 📄 [DSA Short Notes (Markdown)](notes/DSA_short_notes.md) *(readable directly on GitHub)*  
- 📄 [DSA Short Notes (PDF)](notes/DSA_short_notes.pdf)  

These notes cover **Arrays + Strings**:  
- Sliding Window, Prefix Sum, Hashing, Two Pointers, Matrix, Greedy.  
- String patterns: Two Pointers, HashMap, Stack, Sliding Window, Parsing, DP.

## ✅ Topics Covered So Far
### 🔹 Arrays
- Sliding Window  
- Prefix Sum & Hashing  
- Two Pointers  
- HashMap / HashSet  
- Sorting & Greedy  
- Leaders in Array  
- Matrix Problems  
- Advanced Mixed  

### 🔹 Strings
- Two Pointers (Palindrome, Reverse)  
- HashMap / HashSet (Anagrams, Substrings)  
- Stack (Valid Parentheses)  
- Sliding Window (Longest Substring, Minimum Window)  
- Parsing (atoi, Roman ↔ Integer, Add Binary)  
- Dynamic Programming (Palindrome Substring, Decode Ways)  

---

## 🎯 Placement Strategy
- Revise Arrays + Strings fully (80 problems).  
- Next → Linked List, Stack, Queue, Binary Search.  
- Later → Trees, Graphs, DP basics.  
- Target ~200–250 quality problems before placements.  

---

## ⚡ How to Use
- Browse by topic folders (`arrays/`, `strings/`).  
- Refer to **notes** for approaches & patterns.  
- Code is written in **Java** (DSA language for placements).
