**📘 Introduction to DSA (Notes)**

**🔹 What is DSA?**

-   **Data Structures** → Ways of organizing and storing data
    efficiently.

    -   Examples: Arrays, Linked List, Stack, Queue, HashMap, Trees,
        Graphs.

-   **Algorithms** → Step‑by‑step methods to solve problems using data
    structures.

    -   Examples: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy.

Together, **DSA = Data Structures + Algorithms** → backbone of problem
solving and placements.

**🔹 Why is DSA Important?**

-   Improves **problem solving & logic**.

-   Most companies test **DSA in coding rounds** (service + product
    based).

-   Helps you crack **aptitude style problems in technical way**.

-   Builds strong foundation for **AI/ML, Web Dev, System Design**
    later.

**🔹 Core Topics of DSA (Placement Focus)**

1.  **Arrays & Strings** → Basics, sliding window, hashing, prefix sum.

2.  **Hashing (HashMap/HashSet)** → frequency, duplicate, subarray
    problems.

3.  **Two Pointers / Sliding Window** → subarrays, pairs, optimization.

4.  **Recursion & Backtracking** → DFS, generating subsets,
    permutations.

5.  **Linked List** → reversing, cycle detection, merge lists.

6.  **Stacks & Queues** → next greater element, LRU cache, sliding
    window max.

7.  **Binary Search** → on arrays, search in rotated arrays, sqrt(x).

8.  **Sorting & Greedy** → interval scheduling, activity selection.

9.  **Binary Trees / BST** → traversals, lowest common ancestor.

10. **Heaps & Priority Queue** → top k elements, heap sort.

11. **Graphs** → BFS, DFS, shortest path (Dijkstra, BFS).

12. **Dynamic Programming (DP)** → knapsack, longest subsequence, etc.

**🔹 How to Approach DSA Problems**

1.  **Identify the pattern** → (two pointers? sliding window? hashmap?).

2.  **Think brute force** → then optimize.

3.  **Write logic in English first** → then code.

4.  **Dry run with small examples**.

5.  **Analyze time & space complexity**.

**🔹 Time Complexity (Big‑O Basics)**

-   **O(1)** → Constant (direct access).

-   **O(log n)** → Divide & conquer (binary search).

-   **O(n)** → Single loop through array.

-   **O(n log n)** → Sorting, divide & conquer merges.

-   **O(n²)** → Nested loops (brute force).

-   **O(2\^n), O(n!)** → Recursion, backtracking.

👉 Always try to go from **O(n² → O(n log n) → O(n)**.

**🔹 Space Complexity**

-   Measures **extra memory used**.

-   Example: Prefix sum uses O(n) extra space; Kadane's uses O(1).

-   Interviewers sometimes ask to **optimize space** (Set Matrix Zeroes
    problem, etc.).

**🔹 Placement Strategy with DSA**

1.  Finish **Arrays + Strings** (base).

2.  Move to **Hashing, Two Pointers, Sliding Window**.

3.  Do **Linked List, Stack, Queue**.

4.  Practice **Binary Search, Trees, DP** basics.

5.  Keep revising patterns.

6.  Solve \~200--250 quality problems before placements.

DSA:Arrays

**1. Sliding Window 🪟**

👉 Used when dealing with **contiguous subarrays** (fixed or variable
size).

-   Grow/shrink window to track sum, max, or count.

-   **Key:** Keep track of windowSum or currSum.

-   Problems:

    -   **P1. Max Sum Subarray of Size K** → Fixed window, update max.

    -   **P5 & P38. Kadane's Algorithm** → Dynamic window, reset sum if
        \< 0.

    -   **P9. Longest Subarray with Sum K (positive nums)** → Two
        pointers expand/shrink.

**2. Prefix Sum / Hashing ➕**

👉 Precompute sums or XORs to answer subarray queries fast.

-   Formula: prefix\[i\] = prefix\[i-1\] + arr\[i\]

-   With HashMap, store seen sums to detect subarray existence/length.

-   Problems:

    -   **P2. Prefix Sum Query** → Quick subarray sum in O(1).

    -   **P9. Count Subarrays with Sum K** → Map for (sum-k).

-   Problems:

    -   **P3. Two Sum (sorted array)** → left+right approach.

    -   **P4. Move Zeroes** → place non‑zeros, then fill rest with
        zeros.

    -   **P6. Check if Sorted** → compare consecutive.

    -   **P7. Remove Duplicates** → slow/fast pointer.

    -   **P8. Rotate Array by K (Reverse method)** → reverse 3 times.

    -   **P13. Rotate by 1** → shift elements.

    -   **P19. Max Product of Two Elements** → track top 2.

    -   **P23. Second Largest** → track top 2.

    -   **P24. Second Smallest** → track bottom 2.

**4. HashMap / HashSet 🗂️**

👉 When you need **frequency, duplicates, or fast existence check**.

-   HashMap → element → count/index.

-   HashSet → check membership in O(1).

-   Problems:

    -   **P16. Arrays Equal** → frequency check.

    -   **P17. Frequency of Elements** → build map.

    -   **P18. Find Duplicates** → map or marking.

    -   **P21. Longest Consecutive Sequence** → use set to expand.

    -   **P22. Majority Element** → HashMap count \> n/2.

**5. Sorting / Greedy 📊**

👉 Simplify by ordering or picking extremes.

-   Problems:

    -   **P14. Missing Number** → sum formula or XOR trick.

    -   **P15. Single Number** → XOR all.

    -   **P25. Rearrange Array by Sign** → alternate
        positives/negatives.

    -   **P26. Move Negatives to One Side** → stable partition.

    -   **P28. Sort 0s,1s,2s (Dutch Flag)** → 3 pointers for each zone.

**6. Leaders / Special Observations 👑**

👉 Problems that rely on scanning with a **running condition**.

-   **P11. Leaders in Array** → Scan from right, track max so far.

**7. Matrix Problems (2D Arrays) 🟦**

👉 Treat as boundaries or use transpose/rotation.

-   Problems:

    -   **P29. Set Matrix Zeroes** → mark first row/col, then update.

    -   **P30. Spiral Traversal** → top, bottom, left, right boundaries.

    -   **P31. Transpose** → swap a\[i\]\[j\] with a\[j\]\[i\].

    -   **P32. Rotate 90°** → transpose + reverse rows/cols.

    -   **P33. Search in Sorted Matrix** → binary search or top‑right
        walk.

    -   **P34. Pascal's Triangle** → DP relation.

**8. Advanced / Mixed ⚡**

👉 Trickier problems combining multiple ideas.

-   **P35. Pascal's Triangle II** → row wise calculation.

    pointers.

-   **P37. Max Consecutive 1s** → scan & reset counter.

Strings:

### 🔹 What are Strings?

-   A **string** = sequence of characters.

-   In coding, treated like an **array of chars** but with extra
    utilities (Java: String, Python: str, C++: string).

-   Used in text processing, parsing, searching, data encoding, and
    interview problems.

👉 Common **operations/patterns**:

-   **Two pointers** → palindromes, reversing.

-   **HashMap / HashSet** → anagrams, frequency.

# 📚 Linked List Notes – Placement Guide

## Introduction
A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node. Unlike arrays, linked lists are non-contiguous in memory, allowing dynamic size changes.

---

## Node Structure (Java)
```java
class Node {
    int data;   // value
    Node next;  // pointer to next node
    Node(int value) {
        data = value;
        next = null;
    }
}
Memory Example:
[10|next] -> [20|next] -> [30|next] -> null
head -> 10

Basics & Implementation:

Create a Linked List
Create nodes and link them using next pointers.
Each node points to the next node; last node points to null.

Insert at Beginning
Make new node's next = head, then update head = new node.
Time Complexity: O(1)

Insert at End
Traverse to last node, then set last.next = new node.
Time Complexity: O(n)

Insert at Position
Traverse to position-1, adjust pointers: newNode.next = temp.next; temp.next = newNode.
Time Complexity: O(n)

Delete from Beginning
head = head.next
Time Complexity: O(1)

Delete from End
Traverse to second last node, then secondLast.next = null
Time Complexity: O(n)

Delete from Position
Traverse to position-1, then temp.next = temp.next.next
Time Complexity: O(n)

Search an Element
Traverse the list, compare each node's data with key.
Time Complexity: O(n)

Print Linked List
Traverse the list and print each node's data.
Time Complexity: O(n)

Tips:
Always check for head == null.
Use diagrams to visualize pointer updates.

Important Placement Problems:

Reverse Linked List (Iterative)
Use three pointers: prev, curr, next.
Reverse the next links while traversing.
Time Complexity: O(n)

Reverse Linked List (Recursive)
Recursively reverse the list and adjust next pointers during unwind.
Time Complexity: O(n)

Find Middle Node
Use slow & fast pointer approach: slow moves 1 step, fast moves 2 steps.
Slow ends at middle node.
Time Complexity: O(n)

Detect Cycle
Use Floyd’s Tortoise & Hare method.
Slow and fast pointers meet if cycle exists.
Time Complexity: O(n)

Remove Cycle
Detect meeting point, find start of cycle, then set previous node’s next = null.
Time Complexity: O(n)

Merge Two Sorted Lists
Traverse both lists with two pointers, attach the smaller node to a new merged list.
Time Complexity: O(n + m)

Intersection of Two Lists
Use two pointers: switch heads when reaching end.
First meeting point is intersection node.
Time Complexity: O(n + m)

Palindrome Check
Find middle, reverse second half, compare two halves.
Time Complexity: O(n)

Add Two Numbers
Traverse both lists, sum corresponding nodes + carry, create new nodes for result.
Time Complexity: O(max(n, m))

Remove Nth Node from End
Compute length, find (length - n + 1)th node, adjust pointers.
Time Complexity: O(n)

Rotate List by k
Compute k = k % length.
Rotate using reverse technique or adjust pointers.
Time Complexity: O(n)

Memory / Pointer Visualization Examples:
Reverse Iterative:
Before:
head -> 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> null
After:
head -> 30 -> 20 -> 10 -> null
Pointers used: prev, curr, next

Detect Cycle Example:
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 (cycle back to 2)\
Slow and fast pointers meet inside the cycle.
Use this to detect and break the cycle.

Merge Two Sorted Lists Example:
List1: 1 -> 3 -> 5
List2: 2 -> 4 -> 6
Merged: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
Use a dummy node and tail pointer to build merged list.

Intersection of Two Lists Example:
ListA: 10 -> 20 -> 30 \
                          -> 40 -> 50
ListB: 15 --------------/
Intersection at node 40
Two-pointer approach ensures O(n+m) time without extra space.

Tips for Placements:
Draw diagrams for each operation.
Dry-run on paper before coding.
Solve each problem at least twice.
Focus on pointer manipulation, null checks, and edge cases (empty list, single node).
